### Step by step

Meant to use on hidden/stealth mode when computer starts.

1. First of all allow this program on Windows Defender and antivirus programs. Current application could be taken as a threat.
2. Set the program propertie as hidden.
3. Press Win+R
4. Type 

```
shell:startup
```

5. On opened windows create new text file and add following code.
In this example our program location is 'C:\time\time.exe'.
If you save it to somewhere else then edit code accordingly.
First we opeen working directory. And on second step we start our program.

```
Set objShell = CreateObject(“Wscript.Shell”)
objShell.CurrentDirectory = “C:\time”

Set WshShell = CreateObject("WScript.Shell") 
WshShell.Run chr(34) & "time.exe" & Chr(34), 0
Set WshShell = Nothing
```
6. Save the file and close Notepad.
7. Rename the text file to VB Script. For example 'time.vb'. Thats it. Next time you restart your computer our time counter will start invisibly.
